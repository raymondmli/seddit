## Seddit - Frontend

## Quickstart

To start up the frontend server which simply servers everything under the frontend folder:

```
python3 frontend_server.py
```

This will print out a username, password and launch up a static server at localhost:8080, if something else on your network is using 8080 it will start it on some other port.

```
Live at http://localhost:8080
use username 'user' and password '8tv1oz'
```

Use control-c to shut this server down.
